# **Movie Recommendation System**

**Author: Anushka Swami**

**Project Overview**

This movie recommendation system is designed to provide personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences and movie features. it utilizes the power of Pandas,Numpy and scikit-learn to effectively proces and analyze large datasets of movies and user ratings.

In a movie recommendation system using machine learning, the system analyzes user preferences and behaviour, such as movie ratings and viewing history, to make personalized movie suggestions. It uses algorithms to learn patterns and similarities between users and movies, and then recommends movies that are likely to be enjoyed by the user based on those patterns.

**Dataset**

For this project, I utilized the dataset [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/main/Movies%20Recommendation.csv) from the YBI Foundation Kaggle repository. This dataset contains comprehensive information about movies, user ratings, and other relevant features necessary for building our recommendation system.

**How It Works**

Close Match Algorithm: Movie Match uses the Close Match algorithm to identify approximate string matches, accommodating minor input variations such as typos or incomplete titles.

Personalized Recommendations: Input your favourite movies, and Movie Match will provide you with a curated list of movie recommendations tailored just for you.
